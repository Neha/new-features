# :computer: CSS3 New Features Code Demos & more...

This repo is dedicated to all the new CSS features releasing in the CSS.
This is WIP repo and less jazzy UI (I know it should be jazzy , as we are talking about CSS).

# :grey_question: Why?

While learning new CSS3 features and making youtube videos for JSLovers, I started this repo. Also, to reduce the development efforts I have created ready-to-use code samples for the devs.
